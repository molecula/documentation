## Description

Views separate the different data layouts within a Field.

The primary view is standard, which represents the typical base data.

Time based field views are automatically generated for each time quantum.

Views are internally managed by FeatureBase, and never exposed directly via the API.

This simplifies the functional interface by separating it from the physical data representation.
