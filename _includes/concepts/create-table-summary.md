A table is a database object that stores data from an external data source.

FeatureBase tables are similar to those in traditional relational databases:
* tables with columns
* columns with data types and constraints.

The first column is automatically created on all tables and serves as the primary key.

When created, a table is assigned a:
* Table endpoint for use when importing data from a data-source
* Query endpoint for use when querying data using the HTTPS streaming endpoint
