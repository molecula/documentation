You can duplicate your existing RDBMS data structures within FeatureBase.

But to get the best results, users should perform a data modeling process to:
* determine the specific data they wish to query
* take advantage of FeatureBase-specific data types and constraints
* run queries on the data to test if the structure meets expectations

By performing Data Modeling, customers may further reduce their raw data footprint and flatten out tables in order to make queries even faster.
