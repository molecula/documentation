You can duplicate your existing RDBMS data structures within FeatureBase.

But to get the best results, users should perform a Data modeling process to:
* determine the specific data they wish to query
* take advantage of FeatureBase-specific data types and constraints
* run queries on the data to test if the structure meets expectations

By performing Data Modeling, customers may reduce their raw data footprint by up to 90% and thus make queries even faster.
