FeatureBase Cloud has the concept of "shapes" which are based on real-world implementations of FeatureBase and define:
* How much memory is available
* how much disk space is available
* how many Virtual Central Processing Units (vCPUs) are available to perform ingestion and queries

NOTE: Production shapes are not available on trial accounts.
