The Login privilege is granted to all **Active** users via their role.

An Administrator can revoke the Login privilege by **deactivating** the account.

NOTE: {% include contact-support.md%} to delete user accounts.

## Before you begin

{% include /cloud-config/cloud-user-admin-role-needed.md %}
* [Learn about the user status](/cloud/cloud-configuration/cloud-ref-user-status)
{% include /cloud/cloud-before-begin.md %}
* [Invite a cloud user](/cloud/cloud-configuration/cloud-user-invite)

## Deactivate a user

NOTE: You may choose to [change the user role](/cloud/cloud-configuration/cloud-user-edit-role) rather than deactivating the account.

* Click **Configuration** > **Manage users**
* {% include /cloud-icons/icon-edit-unicode.md %} on the **Active** user > **Deactivate user**.

## Reactivate a user

* Click **Configuration** > **Manage users**
* {% include /cloud-icons/icon-edit-unicode.md %} on the **Deactivated** user > **Reactivate User**.
