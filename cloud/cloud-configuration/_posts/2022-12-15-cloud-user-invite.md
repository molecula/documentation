## Invite a cloud user

You can invite a new user to your FeatureBase organization, or one that belongs with a different organization.

* Click **Configuration** > **Manage users**.
* Click **Invite new user**.
* Enter one or more email addresses, using commas to separate them.
* Click **Send invitation**.

## Copy the invitation URL

The invitation URL allows a user to setup their account with their name, a password and to agree with the FeatureBase terms of service.

It is included in the invitation email, but you can also provide the URL via a different method.

* Click **Configuration** > **Manage users**.
* Scroll to **Invited users**
* {%  include /cloud/icon-edit-unicode.md %} on the user > **Copy invite URL**.
