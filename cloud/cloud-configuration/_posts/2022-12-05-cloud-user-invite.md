## Add a cloud user

* Click **Configuration** > **Manage users**.
* Click **Invite new user**.
* Enter one or more email addresses, using commas to separate them.
* Click **Send invitation**

## Copy the invitation URL

The invitation URL allows a user to setup their account with their name, a password and to agree with the FeatureBase terms of service.

When complete, the user can login and has the read-only user role.

* Click **Configuration** > **Manage users**.
* Scroll to **Invited users**
* Click <span class="actionmenubutton"></span> on the user > **Copy invite URL**.
