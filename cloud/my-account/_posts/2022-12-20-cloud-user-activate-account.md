FeatureBase users can create an FeatureBase account in two ways:

* Sign up to create a new organization
* Accept an invitation to an existing FeatureBase organization

## Accept an invitation

You will receive an email when an Administrator invites you to join a FeatureBase organization.

NOTE: You may need to add `noreply@molecula.com` and `noreply@verificationemail.com` to your safe-senders list to receive invitation and confirmation emails.

### Step 1 - enter your account details

* Click **Create my account** on the FeatureBase invitation email
* Enter your first and last name
* Enter a valid password
* Click the checkbox to accept the terms of service
* Click **Next**

### Step 2 - confirm and activate account

FeatureBase sends a confirmation code to your email address.

* Click the [**sign in**](https://cloud.featurebase.com/login){:target="_blank"} link to open the login page.
* Enter your user email and password > **Sign in**.
* Enter the confirmation code then click **Confirm**.

Your user is now **Active** and you have the **user** role.
