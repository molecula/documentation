![Figure 4. FeatureBase Home Screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172454337-c4d9f4c8-4b7f-44df-b58a-49a109b43419.png)


## Configuring your environment

In order to use our application, you’ll need data. In a real-life situation, the Molecula team will provide guided onboarding and data modeling for our organization’s data. In this exercise, we’ll be working with curated demo data to showcase the low-latency capabilities of FeatureBase. Navigate to the ```Deployments``` screen and select ```Quick Start``` to create a deployment pre-loaded with the demo data. 

>This is a great time to grab a cup of coffee or reply to all those waiting Slack messages! A new deployment is spinning up and over 1B records are loading.

![Figure 5. Configure a Quick Start Deployment that is pre-loaded with demo data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172458725-1c694f0c-844f-42af-aebf-2b2c1cf33652.png)


While the deployment is spinning up, you will see messages on the ```Deployments``` screen as the status progresses. While the deployment is ```CREATING```, data is being loaded in. 

![Figure 6. New Deployment: Creating](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172473382-faf27555-f95b-4620-b601-1ae0664e6b4e.png)

![Figure 7. New Deployment: Running](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172477895-53ed7158-2145-4345-b2ee-f1904ade4f42.png)


After about 30 minutes the deployment status will progress to ```RUNNING``` and you can check the ```Tables``` section of the application to see the two tables that have been restored into the deployment. One table is called ```cseg```, short for customer segmentation, and the other is called ```skills```. A description of each table is also listed. In the next section, we will perform a variety of common analytical queries on both datasets.

![Figure 8. Demo Data restored into tables from backup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172478012-37e6c7f2-8e3d-41d0-bf90-67adde1bf866.png)


### Data Exploration of Customer Segmentation Feature Table

It’s always a good idea to understand what the dataset you’re working with contains before you get started. To do this, click on the ```Tables``` section in the application to display the names of the tables in your deployment.

Click on a table to show its contents. FeatureBase can ingest and represent a wide range of field types. One that may not be familiar is the ```SET``` field. ```SET``` fields are multi-valued and allow FeatureBase to collapse traditional data models, like the star schema, by efficiently storing multiple values for a single field.

![Figure 9. Customer Segmentation (cseg) table details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172478357-9a5af187-aed8-4890-abb7-ce3efb390ef2.png)


To understand the shape of the data contained in the customer dataset that was preloaded into this environment. First, navigate to the Query page by clicking ```Query``` on the left navigation bar. 

Let’s start by running a simple SQL statement to extract 10 records to explore.

```sql
SELECT * FROM cseg LIMIT 10;
```

Viewing this tabular output we can see each record contains several fields (attributes) and data types. Scroll left and right in the application to explore the full list of fields. For example, ```names``` and ```cities``` are captured in ```STRING``` fields. ```Income``` is captured in an ```INT``` field that will allow for range queries. You can also see that ```education``` is a ```SET``` field with multiple values in a single field.

![Figure 10. Select top ten items from table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172478664-88393a0d-6357-4050-8f84-211685b5c4a3.png)

Next, let’s check the full scale of this dataset by using another familiar SQL statement, the ```COUNT``` to return how many records are in the table.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cseg;
```

This query will return the ```COUNT``` of records in the entire table and demonstrates we are working with a dataset of 1 billion records. Each record in the cseg table has 16 attributes.

![Figure 11. Count all records in table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172478854-223530c5-ae7e-44ad-aa06-32d9e5aceb60.png)


### Performing Large Aggregations

Aggregation workflows often require the ability to ```SUM``` large amounts of individual ```INT``` elements. This could be transaction amounts such as dollars (decimals), whole integers (counts, bandwidth), or any variation requiring a ```SUM``` across many records. In this example, we will ```SUM``` the ```income``` field across all 1 billion records.

```sql
SELECT SUM(income) FROM cseg;
```

![Figure 12. SUM Query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172479247-02641dbf-3823-41c7-b63d-0ab962453c03.png)


It is unlikely to need to ```SUM``` in this manner across all records. It is much more common to introduce complex conditions to ```SUM``` a segment of records that meets specified criteria.

Here we introduce comparative and logical operators including ```GREATER THAN```, ```AND```, and ```OR```. 

```sql
SELECT SUM(income) 
FROM cseg 
WHERE income > 5000 AND age = 45 AND (skills='Ms Office' OR skills='Excel');
```

As you can see, the latency is in the sub-second time frame even when using complex searching criteria through 1 billion records.

![Figure 13. Complex SUM Query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172479333-604dae4d-0530-4d67-8758-cef89b365220.png)


>NOTE:
>When aggregating over a SET field, values for a record will be included in multiple groups if not excluded in the query. For example, when SUM(income) is >used with a GROUP BY of “education”, income for a record with both ‘Bachelor’s degree’ and ‘High school diploma or GED’ will be included in both groups.

>It is common for a single person to have multiple values for a field that may seem contradictory or redundant, like “education”. This may be due to differences in status over time as data are collected and aggregated. A person may be categorized as having “education” status of “Some college” and later be categorized as having a “Bachelor’s degree”. When those two data sources are matched up, the person may have multiple values associated with them.

Additionally, aggregations may include the ```AVERAGE``` argument.

```sql
SELECT AVG(income) FROM cseg;
```

>Note that we don’t currently support full SQL, but are working toward expanding SQL functionality. For example, the ```AVERAGE``` function is not currently supported in ```GROUP BY``` queries and will be added soon.

![Figure 14. AVERAGE Query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172479678-c76e9138-eafe-4176-a55e-a7468a613ea6.png)


### INNER JOINs at Scale

FeatureBase can merge at ingest and eliminate preprocessing in cases where performant **INNER JOIN**s are required. Data from two separate tables or sources can be merged into a single normalized table by matching on a unique key in each dataset. Since FeatureBase can execute queries very quickly, workflows requiring ```INNER JOIN```s can be simplified with FeatureBase by merging disparate datasets at ingest. In the following example, we are combining many of the queries in this guide and adding the ```INNER JOIN```. 

The ```INNER JOIN``` is facilitating a ```COUNT``` of records, or people, are ```available for hire``` as indicated by  that have a string field true for ```available_for_hire``` located in the skills table, and have the string field true for ```Teaching```. In other words, we would like to ```COUNT``` the number of people who are teachers and also available for hire. The latency on this type of ```INNER JOIN``` at the billion records scale is still sub-second allowing for several interesting data models.

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS count 
FROM cseg AS t1 
INNER JOIN skills AS t2 ON t1._id = t2.id 
WHERE t2.bools = 'available_for_hire' and t1.hobbies = 'Teaching';
```
![Figure 15. INNER JOIN Query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172479909-00ce634e-8222-4439-b8bd-fc8034218bd5.png)

>NOTE: Included in the stock dataset is a table known as skills, please use the discovery queries to take a look!



### Grouping with Complex Conditions and Aggregating

Another query commonly seen in aggregation-related use cases is the ```GROUP BY```. For example, let’s group by the hobbies counting only those with ultimate ```COUNT``` above 200,000,000.

```sql
SELECT hobbies, COUNT(*) 
FROM cseg 
GROUP BY hobbies HAVING count > 200000000;
```
![Figure 16. GROUP BY Query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172480187-51760691-a01a-48e9-bd54-a7e9d986fe59.png)



Another useful facet of ```GROUP BY``` is the ability to add an aggregate argument and utilize the low-latency aggregation in another capacity.

```sql
SELECT education, SUM(income) 
FROM cseg 
WHERE age=18 
GROUP BY education; 
```
![Figure 17. GROUP BY Query with Filters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172480326-07391ee9-ed0c-447e-aade-c9ded1624599.png)


### TopK - A FeatureBase Superpower

Ranking queries are notorious for being computationally intensive - aka slow. Some solutions will use statistics to speed up a ranking query by approximating the true results, but that’s not always a desirable option. In addition to SQL, FeatureBase has a native language called PQL. In PQL, ```TopK``` queries can be run to return exact results in milliseconds. 

This query returns the top five hobbies across all customers from the cseg table, sifting through a billion records in 117.2ms.

```
[cseg]TopK(hobbies, k=5)
```
![Figure 18. TOP K Query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172480514-810b86f7-d708-44b3-a28c-0a3ae1a3fabc.png)


More complex, the next query returns the top ten hobbies among females who also like scuba diving from the ```cseg``` table in milliseconds. Even when adding complex filtering, the ```TopK``` queries can be run for exact results at scale without impacting query latency.

```
[cseg]TopK(hobbies, k=10, filter=Intersect(Row(sex=Female),Row(hobbies='Scuba Diving')))
```

![Figure 19. TOP K Query with Filters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172480759-b1c6c0cc-4bc7-4ddc-9f2e-9dc855f1d5e2.png)


>NOTE: At this point, we encourage you to mix and match segmentation criteria to experience low-latency queries even as complex conditions are added.

## What’s Next?

We hope that this hands-on experience has further demonstrated the power of FeatureBase to power real-time analytics workflows at scale. While this example focused on a customer segmentation use case, the same type of workflows are often used in anomaly detection or business process optimization use cases and continues to perform as workloads grow to trillions of records. Additionally, FeatureBase excels at combining streaming and historical data in real-time, allowing you to analyze data as soon at is available in FeatureBase with no need for time-consuming preprocessing or preaggregation. From here, partner with your Molecula representative to better understand how FeatureBase will work for your organization’s specific needs.

## Spinning Down a Deployment

When you have completed the trial, please take a few minutes to spin down your deployment. If you do not spin it down, it will be done after 7 days by the Molecula team.

First, delete the tables in the deployment in the ```Tables``` tab. Click the three dots and select ```Delete```

![Figure 20. Delete Table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172481025-dad7ee69-2752-4ced-b45a-e9d1213a9a20.png)


Confirm the deletion by typing ```DELETE``` into the interface. Repeat for each table in the deployment.

![Figure 21. Confirm Delete Table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172481085-e5fdcadc-4e5b-40cf-bc7c-6ef2d545989e.png)


Repeat the process in the ```Deployments``` screen for each deployment that you want to spin down. It may take a few minutes longer to delete a Deployment than a typical Table. 

![Figure 22. Delete Deployment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97700520/172481339-f1e85f6d-1ba6-4f25-abdc-aca89b63b3ad.png)
