This document contains instructions for manually installing FeatureBase on a single node.

## Linux with systemd

:::note
For FeatureBase 4.4.0 or later
:::

### Install FeatureBase and Consumers

Extract the Molecula tarball.

Copy binaries to `/usr/local/bin/`, being sure to choose the correct binaries for your OS
 and CPU architecture, typically linux-amd64 for Linux:

- `featurebase`
- `molecula-consumer/*`

Copy files, and confirm settings are correct:
- configuration file `featurebase.conf` to `/etc/`
- service file `featurebase.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/`

Sample setup files are provided [below](#sample-files).

Create user `molecula` using a secure password:

```shell
adduser molecula
```

Create a log folder:

```shell
sudo mkdir /var/log/molecula
```

Change the ownership of the log folder to `molecula`:

```shell
sudo chown molecula /var/log/molecula
```

Create a data folder:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /opt/molecula/featurebase
```

Change the ownership of the data folder to `molecula`:

```shell
sudo chown molecula /opt/molecula/featurebase
```

Refresh systemd so the services will load:

```shell
systemctl daemon-reload
```


Start Molecula services:

- `sudo systemctl start featurebase`
- `sudo systemctl enable featurebase`

Verify startup:

- `sudo systemctl status featurebase`

Inspect Logs:

- `journalctl -u featurebase -r`

Install the postgres client for psql:

```shell
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client
```

or

```shell
sudo yum install postgresql
```


### Test the Installation via HTTP

Running this command:
```shell
curl localhost:10101
```

Should result in output similar to this:

```text
Welcome. FeatureBase is running. Visit https://docs.molecula.cloud for more information.
```

Running this command:

```shell
curl localhost:10101/status
```

Should result in output similar to this:

```json
{"state":"NORMAL","nodes":[{"id":"fbd5bdca-b741-4e2d-ad1d-e033fe0d91a2","uri":{"scheme":"http","host":"10.0.0.3","port":10101},"grpc-uri":{"scheme":"grpc","host":"10.0.0.3","port":20101},"isCoordinator":true,"state":"READY"}],"localID":"fbd5bdca-b741-4e2d-ad1d-e033fe0d91a2"}
```


#### Test the Installation via Postgres 

Running this command:
```shell
psql -h localhost -p 55432 -c "show tables;"
```

Should result in output similar to this:

```text
 Table
-------
 user
(1 row)
```


### Install Python Library

With Python3 available, install dependencies.

For Red Hat:

```shell
yum install python-devel
yum install gcc-c++
```

For Debian:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-dev-is-python3
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Install the python-molecula whl file:

```shell
pip3 install molecula-1.5.2-py3-none-any.whl
```

#### Test the Python installation

In a python3 script or REPL, this line should succeed if the installation completed:

```python
import molecula
```

To verify the connection to the VDSM, try to retrieve the VDS list:
```python
client = molecula.Client('localhost:20101')
for vds in client.get_vds_list():
    print(vds)
```

## MacOS

:::note
For Molecula 2.1.1
:::

:::important
As with many data stores, FeatureBase requires open file limits to be increased from their defaults. Managing open file limits changes frequently with MacOS versions. Here are a few resources to consult:

- [max-file-count configuration option](/reference/featurebase-configuration#max-file-count)
- https://gist.github.com/tombigel/d503800a282fcadbee14b537735d202c
- https://docs.riak.com/riak/kv/latest/using/performance/open-files-limit/index.html#mac-os-x-el-capitan
:::

Extract the Molecula tarball.

Copy binaries to `/usr/local/bin/`, being sure to choose the correct binaries for your OS
 and CPU architecture, typically darwin-amd64 for MacOS.

- `featurebase`
- `molecula-consumer/*`

Copy file, and confirm settings are correct:

- configuration file `featurebase.conf` to `/etc/`:

Sample setup files are provided [below](#sample-files).

Create a log folder:

```shell
sudo mkdir /var/log/molecula
```

Change the ownership of the log folder to your username:

```shell
sudo chown $USER /var/log/molecula
```

Create a data folder:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /opt/molecula/featurebase
```

Start Molecula apps as background processes:
- `featurebase server -c /etc/featurebase.conf &`

Install a postgres client for psql. We recommend installing via Homebrew:

```shell
brew install postgresql
```


### Test the Installation via HTTP

Running this command:
```shell
curl localhost:10101
```

Should result in output similar to this:

```text
Welcome. FeatureBase is running. Visit https://docs.molecula.cloud for more information.
```

Running this command:

```shell
curl localhost:10101/status
```

Should result in output similar to this:

```json
{"state":"NORMAL","nodes":[{"id":"fbd5bdca-b741-4e2d-ad1d-e033fe0d91a2","uri":{"scheme":"http","host":"10.0.0.3","port":10101},"grpc-uri":{"scheme":"grpc","host":"10.0.0.3","port":20101},"isCoordinator":true,"state":"READY"}],"localID":"fbd5bdca-b741-4e2d-ad1d-e033fe0d91a2"}
```


#### Test the Installation via Postgres 

Running this command:
```shell
psql -h localhost -p 55432 -c "show tables;"
```

Should result in output similar to this:

```text
 Table
-------
 user
(1 row)
```


### Install Python Library

```shell
unzip python-molecula-1.7.0.zip
cd python-molecula-1.7.0
python3 setup.py install
```


#### Test the Python installation

In a python3 script or REPL, this line should succeed if the installation completed:

```python
import molecula
```


To verify the connection to the VDSM, try to retrieve the VDS list:
```python
client = molecula.Client('localhost:20101')
for vds in client.get_vds_list():
    print(vds)
```
