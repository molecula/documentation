FeatureBase supports querying via its gRPC interface.  

By default, the interface is available on port 20101. To change to a different port, use either the command-line flag `--bind-grpc <address:port>` or the yaml configuration key `bind-grpc`.  

The command-line tool [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) is used here to show usage examples.

## gRPC API with Authentication
When authentication is enabled, gRPC endpoints can be authenticated by passing a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header. The token may be obtained by following these [instructions](/how-tos/enable-auth#how-to-get-auth-token).

```
grpcurl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' localhost:20101 pilosa.Pilosa.GetIndexes
```
## Endpoint details
In the examples below, "None" is used to indicate whenever the request or result is supposed to be an empty message.  

The following gRPC calls are available:

### CreateIndex

Creates an index (table).

Request:

* `name` of type `string` (name of index)
* `keys` of type `bool` (optional, to enable string column keys, defaults `false`)

Response:

* None

Example:

```shell
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"name": "repository", "keys": true}' \
    localhost:20101 pilosa.Pilosa.CreateIndex
```

```json
{

}
```

### GetIndexes

List the indexes present in FeatureBase.

Request:

* None

Response:

* List of `Index` messages. Each `Index` contains a `name` of type `string`. Each name identifies the respective index.

Example:

```shell
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:20101 pilosa.Pilosa.GetIndexes
```

```json
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "name": "customer_segmentation"
    },
    {
      "name": "example"
    },
    {
      "name": "repository"
    }
  ]
}
```

### GetIndex

Use to check if a specific index exists. Returns an `Index` message if it exists, otherwise, it returns a `NotFound` error.

Request:

* `name` as type `string` (name of the index)

Response:

* `Index` message, containing a `name` of type `string`

Example:

```shell
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"name": "repository"}' localhost:20101 pilosa.Pilosa.GetIndex
```

```json
{
  "index": {
    "name": "repository"
  }
}
```

### DeleteIndex

Delete a given index. Returns a `NotFound` error if the given index does not exist.

Request:

* `name` as `string` (name of index)

Response:

* None

Example:

```shell
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"name": "example"}' localhost:20101 pilosa.Pilosa.DeleteIndex
```

```json
{

}
```

### QuerySQL

Query FeatureBase using SQL. This call is non-blocking from the client's perspective: the server sends the response in 'chunks' and the client can handle each response asynchronously. This can be useful when the result set is large in size. Terminating the SQL string with ';' is optional.

Request:

* `sql` as `string` (the sql query)

Response:

* `headers` as list of `ColumnInfo`. The headers are only present on the first record received. Each ColumnInfo entry consists of the following fields:
  
  - `name` as `string`
  - `datatype` as `string`

* `columns` as list of `ColumnResponse`. Each ColumnResponse entry consists of a field whose name and type depends on the schema of the table. For example, if the column consists of strings, it will have the name `stringVal` and type `string`. Similarly, if it consists of boolean values, it will have the name `boolVal` and type `bool`. Note that the number of ColumnResponse entries is equal to the number of ColumnInfo entries.

* `duration` as an `integer` containing the number of nanoseconds it took for the server to complete the request.

Example:

```shell
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"sql": "select count(*) from repository"}' \
    localhost:20101 pilosa.Pilosa.QuerySQL
```

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "name": "count(*)",
      "datatype": "uint64"
    }
  ],
  "columns": [
    {
      "uint64Val": "161"
    }
  ],
  "duration": 534456
}
```

### QuerySQLUnary

Query FeatureBase using SQL. As its name indicates, this is a unary call - it follows a typical synchronous request-response pattern. That is, the client blocks on the call until the entire response arrives.

Request:

* `sql` as `string` (the sql query)

Response:

* `headers` as list of `ColumnInfo`. Each ColumnInfo entry consists of the following fields:
  - `name` as `string`
  - `datatype` as `string`

* `rows` as list of `Row`. Each Row entry consists of a list of `ColumnResponse`. The structure of a ColumnResponse is detailed in the QuerySQL call section.

* `duration` as an `integer` containing the number of nanoseconds it took for the server to complete the request.

Example:

```shell
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"sql": "select count(*) from repository"}' \
    localhost:20101 pilosa.Pilosa.QuerySQLUnary
```

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "name": "count(*)",
      "datatype": "uint64"
    }
  ],
  "rows": [
    {
      "columns": [
        {
          "uint64Val": "161"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "duration": 408939
}
```

### QueryPQL

The PQL counterpart to `QuerySQL`.

Request:

* `index` as `string` (name of index)
* `pql` as `string` (actual PQL query)

Response:

* `headers` as list of `ColumnInfo`. The headers are only present on the first record received. Each ColumnInfo entry consists of the following fields:
  
  - `name` as `string`
  - `datatype` as `string`

* `columns` as list of `ColumnResponse`. Each ColumnResponse entry consists of a field whose name and type depends on the schema of the table. For example, if the column consists of strings, it will have the name `stringVal` and type `string`. Similarly, if it consists of boolean values, it will have the name `boolVal` and type `bool`. Note that the number of ColumnResponse entries is equal to the number of ColumnInfo entries.

* `duration` as an `integer` containing the number of nanoseconds it took for the server to complete the request.

Example:

```shell
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"pql": "Row(language=1)", "index": "repository"}' \
    localhost:20101 pilosa.Pilosa.QueryPQL
```

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "name": "_id",
      "datatype": "uint64"
    }   
  ],
  "columns": [
    {
      "uint64Val": "0"
    }
  ],
  "duration": 116070
}
// Truncated
```

### QueryPQLUnary

The PQL counterpart to `QuerySQLUnary`.

Request:

* `index` as `string` (name of index)
* `pql` as `string` (actual PQL query)

Response:

* `headers` as list of `ColumnInfo`. Each ColumnInfo entry consists of the following fields:
  - `name` as `string`
  - `datatype` as `string`
* `rows` as list of `Row`. Each Row entry consists of a list of `ColumnResponse`. The structure of a ColumnResponse is detailed in the QuerySQL call section.
* `duration` as an `integer` containing the number of nanoseconds it took for the server to complete the request.

Example:

```shell
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"pql": "Row(language=1, limit=1)", "index": "repository"}' \
    localhost:20101 pilosa.Pilosa.QueryPQLUnary
```

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "name": "_id",
      "datatype": "uint64"
    }   
  ],
  "rows": [
    {
      "columns": [
        {
          "uint64Val": "0"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "duration": 116070
}
```
