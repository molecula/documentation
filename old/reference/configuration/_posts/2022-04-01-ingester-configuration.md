Also see the [consumer examples](/how-tos/consumer-usage-examples) page for usage examples with corresponding data and configuration files <!-- TODO and queries -->.

## Authentication
When authentication is enabled, a valid JWT must be passed to the `auth-token` flag for any ingester. The token may be obtained by following these [instructions](/how-tos/enable-auth#how-to-get-auth-token). Only users with admin permissions will be able to perform ingest.

## Kafka Ingester

The Kafka ingester reads Avro-encoded records from a Kafka topic, uses the Confluent schema registry to decode them, and ingests the data into Molecula.

Use `molecula-consumer-kafka -h `to list all available flags. Each flag is also available as an environment variable by prefixing it with "CONSUMER_" and converting any dots or dashes to underscores. For example tls.ca-certificate becomes CONSUMER_TLS_CA_CERTIFICATE.

Note: In order for TLS to be used, the various TLS options need to be set, but each service URL must also include the appropriate protocol (e.g. FeatureBase hosts should look like "https://featurebase0.local:10101").

## Kafka Delete Ingester

The Kafka delete ingester configuration is the same as the Kafka ingester with the addition of `pilosa-grpc-hosts` (or `featurebase-grpc-hosts` with the [`--future.rename` configuration flag](/reference/featurebase-rename)) which is the endpoint on which FeatureBase is listening for GRPC connections. This is necessary as the delete ingester uses an `Inspect` call to figure out what values need to be deleted and that call is only available over this interface. By default it's `localhost:20101`.


## Kafka Static Ingester

The Kafka static ingester configuration is the same as the Kafka ingester, except for:

- Removal of `registry-url`,
- Addition of `header` which is a path to a schema definition (or "header") file in JSON format,
- Addition of `allow-missing-fields`.

The header file is formatted as an array of objects, each of which describes one ingester field:

```json
[
	{
		"name": "the name of the destination field in FeatureBase",
		"path": ["the location within the JSON blob to locate the value of this field"],
		"type": "string",
		"config": {
			"example": "An optional parameter for a field type."
		}
	}
]
```

| Flag                 | Type   | Descriptions                                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| header               | string | Path to the static schema, in JSON header format.                                                       |
| allow-missing-fields | bool   | Will proceed with ingest even if a field is missing from a record but specified in the JSON config file. |

### Value Path Selection

The path option is an array of JSON object keys which are applied in order.
For example, `["a","b","c"]` would select `1` within `{"a":{"b":{"c":1}}}`.
This path must only consist of strings - array indexing is not supported. If a value is missing, the ingester will return an error. To override this behavior for non-primary key fields, use `allow-missing-fields`.

### Types

The available values for `type` are:

| `"type":`            | JSON Input Type                         | FeatureBase Field Type                       | Config Options                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `"id"`               | `10`                                    | set/mutex/time                               | `"Mutex"`, `"Quantum"`, `"CacheConfig"`          |
| `"ids"`              | `[1, 2, 3]`                             | set/time                                     | `"Quantum"`, `"CacheConfig"`                     |
| `"string"`           | `"example"`                             | keyed set/mutex/time                         | `"Mutex"`, `"Quantum"`, `"CacheConfig"`          |
| `"strings"`          | `["a", "b", "c"]`                       | keyed set/time                               | `"Mutex"`, `"Quantum"`, `"CacheConfig"`          |
| `"bool"`             | `true`/`false`                          | packed bool field (row in keyed set fields)  | None                                             |
| `"int"`              | `10`/`-12`/`"example"`                  | integer (possibly a foreign-index reference) | `"Min"`, `"Max"`, `"ForeignIndex"`               |
| `"decimal"`          | `10.9`/`"10.9"`                         | decimal                                      | `"Scale"`                                        |
| `"signedIntBoolKey"` | `10`/`-12`                              | same as id, except a negative value clears   | None                                             |
| `"recordTime"`       | `"2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"`/`1273823` | applied to id(s)/string(s) (using "Quantum") | `"Layout"`, `"Epoch"`,`"Unit"`                   |
| `"dateInt"`          | `"2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"`/`1273823` | integer timestamp relative to an epoch       | `"Layout"`, `"Epoch"`, `"Unit"`, `"CustomUnit"`  |
| `"timestamp"`        | `"2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"`/`1273823` | integer(BSI) timestamp relative to an epoch  | `"Granularity"`, `"Layout"`, `"Epoch"`, `"Unit"` |

### Field Configuration Options

When all config options are left as default, the `"Config"` field may be omitted. Otherwise, the config options are:
* `"Mutex"`: if set to `true`, the data will be ingested into a mutex field instead of a set field
* `"Quantum"`: the time quantum selection (e.g. `"YM"`/`"YMD"`) to use when ingesting into a time field using the time value from a `"recordTime"`
* `"CacheConfig"`: the configuration when using a `TopN` cache; does not affect time fields
* `"Layout"`: the format in which to parse time strings (defaults to RFC3339) - specified in [Go's format](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#pkg-constants)
* `"Min"`: the minimum possible value for an acceptable integer (defaults to -2^63)
* `"Max"`: the maximum possible value for an acceptable integer (defaults to 2^63 - 1)
* `"ForeignIndex"`: the target index to reference columns of
* `"Scale"`: the number of digits of precision to store after the decimal point
* `"Epoch"`: the epoch which timestamps should be relative to. The value may specify a timezone, for example `"1980-11-30T14:20:28.000+07:00"`, or use zulu time (i.e. +00:00) `"1980-11-30T14:20:28.000Z"`. Defaults to the Unix epoch if not configured.
* `"Unit"`: the time unit in which to store a timestamp (`dateInt`) or the incoming value interpreted as a duration with this `Unit`, starting at the configured `Epoch` (`recordTime`, `timestamp`). Can be `"d"`, `"h"`, `"m"`, `"s"`, `"ms"`, `"us"`, `"ns"`, for day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, nanosecond respectively or `"c"` for custom (using `"CustomUnit"` for `dateInt`). Defaults to `"s"`.
* `"CustomUnit"`: a 'duration' value which specifies a custom time unit; accepts values like "6h" for 6 hours, "1m30s" for 1 minute and 30 seconds; valid units can be described using "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m", or "h"
* `"Granularity"`: the resolution at which the incoming values will be stored. Allowed values are `s`, `ms`, `us`, `ns`. Defaults to `"s"`.

The `"CacheConfig"` option specifies the size and type of a [`TopN`](/reference/pql#topn) cache for a set or mutex field.
This "cache" is used for the `TopN` approximation.
The default setting is:
```json
{
	"CacheType": "ranked",
	"CacheSize": 50000,
}
```

When using the `"ranked"` cache type, increasing the "cache" size will increase the number of top rows tracked within a shard of data (theoretically improving precision).
Assuming that the cache is full (the field has more than `"CacheSize"` rows within each shard), the `TopN` cache's memory usage is jointly proportional to the cache size and number of shards.

This cache can also be disabled by setting the type to `"none"`.
Disabling the `TopN` cache will prevent `TopN` from working.
When operating on a field without a cache, a slower [`TopK`](/reference/pql#topk) or sorted [`GroupBy`](/reference/pql#groupby) query may be used instead.

For `"recordTime"` fields, there are essentially two modes. If `"Epoch"` or `"Unit"` are set, then the incoming data is interpreted as a number. Otherwise it's assumed that the incoming data is interpreted as a date/timestamp and the `"Layout"` is used to parse that value.

## CSV Ingester

The CSV ingester can read CSV files (optionally gzipped) and ingest them to FeatureBase. It uses a naming convention in the header of the CSV file to [specify how each field](/reference/ingester-configuration#header-descriptions) should be ingested. The header can either be included in the file or passed in separately if editing the file is not desirable. If passed in separately one should use the `--ignore-header` option if the CSV file has a header so that it is not interpreted as data.

Use `molecula-consumer-csv -h` to list all available flags. Each flag is also available as an environment variable by prefixing it with "CONSUMER_".

| Flag            | Type    | Description                                                                                                                   |
| -               | -       | -                                                                                                                             |
| 	files         | strings | List of files, URLs, or directories to ingest.                                                                                |
| 	header        | strings | Optional header. If not passed, first line of each file is used.                                                              |
| 	ignore-header | bool    | Ignore header in file and use configured header. You *must* configure a header.                                               |
| 	just-do-it    | bool    | Any header field not in the appropriate format, just downcase, use it as the name and process the value as a String/set field |

### Missing Values

Missing values and empty string values (`""`) are handled identically.

| Field Type 	| Expected Behavior	During CSV Ingestion																			|
| -------------	| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
|`"ID"`			| Raise error during ingestion if `"ID"` is selected for primary-key-field. Otherwise, behave same as `"String"`. 	|
|`"DateInt"`	| Raise error during ingestion - timestamp must have a valid value.													|
|`"Timestamp"`	| Raise error during ingestion - input is not time. 																|
|`"RecordTime"`	| Do not update value in index. 																					|
|`"Int"` 		| Do not update value in index. 								 													|
|`"Decimal"`	| Do not update value in index. 																					|
|`"String"`		| Do not update value in index. 																					|
|`"Bool"`		| Do not update value in index. 																					|
|`"StringArray"`| Do not update value in index. 																					|
|`"IDArray"`	| Do not update value in index. 																					|
|`"ForeignKey"` | Do not update value in index. 																				 	|

## SQL Ingester

The SQL ingester uses a sql connection (via MSSQL, MySQL, or Postgres) to select data from a sql endpoint, and ingests the data into Molecula. It uses the SQL table column names as [header descriptions to specify how each field](/reference/ingester-configuration#header-descriptions) should be ingested, similar to the CSV Ingester.

Use `molecula-consumer-sql -h` to list all available flags (or see table below). A few sample configurations are noted below:

```shell
molecula-consumer-sql \
	--connection-string 'server=sqldb.myserver.com;userid=mysqlusername;password=secret;database=mydbname' \
	--pilosa-hosts 10.0.0.1:10101 \
	--batch-size 1000000 \
	--driver=mssql \
	--index=myindexname \
	--id-field=id \
	--row-expr 'SELECT tableID as id__ID, zipcode as zipcode__String limit 10'
```

Or, equivalently, with the [`--future.rename` configuration flag](/reference/featurebase-rename) configuration flag:

```shell
molecula-consumer-sql \
    --future.rename \
	--connection-string 'server=sqldb.myserver.com;userid=mysqlusername;password=secret;database=mydbname' \
	--featurebase-hosts 10.0.0.1:10101 \
	--batch-size 1000000 \
	--driver=mssql \
	--index=myindexname \
	--id-field=id \
	--row-expr 'SELECT tableID as id__ID, zipcode as zipcode__String limit 10'
```

Example connection strings:

MySQL:
```shell
--driver mysql --connection-string 'myusername:password@(10.0.0.1:3306)/mydb'
```
MS SQL:
```shell
--driver mssql --connection-string 'server=sqldb.myserver.com;userid=mysqlusername;password=secret;database=mydbname'
```
Postgres:
```shell
--driver postgres --connection-string 'postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/molecula?sslmode=disable'
```
or
```shell
--driver postgres --connection-string 'user=postgres password=password host=localhost port=5432 dbname=molecula sslmode=disable'
```

## Header Descriptions

The [CSV](/reference/ingester-configuration#csv-ingester) and [SQL](/reference/ingester-configuration#sql-ingester) ingesters use the same syntax for describing how you want the fields in your source data to be ingested into Molecula. The basic structure is

`field_name__FieldType_Arg1_Arg2`

That is, you name each field, and then you specify the field's type (separated by two underscores), and then any arguments that the field type takes. For example:

`age__Int_0_120`

declares that field is named 'age', is expected to be an integer, and be between 0 and 120. In general, all arguments are optional, but they are also positional, so if you want to specify a maximum value for the int field, you must first specify a minimum value.

Here is the full list of field types along with their arguments:

### String
Example:
`state__String_T_YMD`

String is for arbitrary string data. The data will be stored in a 'set', 'mutex', or 'time' type field depending on the arguments given, but will always use key translation.

Argument 1 — Mutex: Either 'T' or 'F'. Specifies whether a "mutex" type field should be used  in FeatureBase. If 'T', a "mutex" field is used, and any particular record may only have a single value. If 'F', a "set" field is used, and a particular record may have multiple values for this field.

Argument 2 — Time Quantum: If this argument is provided, the field will be a "time" field rather than "set" or "mutex". "time" fields work similarly to "set" fields but each value can have a coarse grained timestamp associated with it. The granularity is controlled by this argument and can be anything from yearly down to hourly. See the [FeatureBase Data Model docs](/explanations/data-modeling) for more information about time fields.

### ID
Example:
`class__ID_T_YMD`

ID has the same arguments and works the same way as String, but doesn't use key translation. The values must be parseable into unsigned integers.

### Bool
Example:
`is_alive__Bool`

Bool will either be stored in a "bool" field, or into packed bools fields if that option is enabled and available on the ingester in use. In the case of packed bools, the name of the field becomes the value at which a bit will be set in the "bools" and "bools-exists" fields. The ingester attempts to coerce incoming data to `true` or `false`. Any integer value will be interpreted as `false` if 0 and `true` otherwise. The strings (in any upper/lower case combination) '0', 'f', 'false',  and the empty string will be interpreted as `false`, and `true` otherwise.

No arguments.

### Int
Example:
`age__Int_1_120`

Int will be stored in an "int" field in FeatureBase. A string value will be attempted to be parsed as an integer.

Argument 1 — Min: The lower bound on the field's values.

Argument 2 — Max: The upper bound on the field's values.

### Decimal
Example:
`cost__Decimal_2`

Decimal will be stored in a "decimal" field in FeatureBase. Strings will be attempted to be parsed as floats. Note that values will be truncated to the appropriate decimal place, not rounded, so you should round the value as needed before ingesting.

Argument 1 — Scale: The "scale" for the decimal field. Essentially the number of digits after the decimal point that you wish to store. In the example we have a cost, so we use a scale of '2' to track cost in dollars down to the cent.

### ForeignKey
Example:
`user_id__ForeignKey_users`

ForeignKey is used when values of a field refer to records in another table. The foreign table may be using keys or not, and if it is using keys, the foreign key values can be strings, otherwise they should be unsigned integers. Under the hood, this uses an int field, so each record may only have a single value (as opposed to a 'set' field where each record may have many values associated).

Argument 1 — The name of the foreign table.

### DateInt
Example:
`modified_day__DateInt_2006-01-02_1970-01-01_C_1d`

DateInt stores a datetime in an "int" field in FeatureBase. The dates are converted to ints according to the arguments. The integer value stored represents the number of units of time since some 'epoch' time.

Argument 1 - Layout: gives an example format for how the date value should be parsed. The default value for layout is '2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00'. Write this same datetime in whatever format your values have. For example, for a traditional MM/DD/YYYY representation, you would use '01/02/2006' for layout.

Argument 2 - Epoch: The 'zero' timestamp from which the int values are calculated. Written using the same layout as specified by argument 1.

Argument 3 - Unit: The time unit to store. If the unit is a day, then a value of 17 means 17 days since the epoch. Unit may be `"d"`, `"h"`, `"m"`, `"s"`, `"ms"`, `"us"`, `"ns"` or `"c"` for custom. If `"c"` is used, argument 4 specifies the customer duration.

Argument 4 - Custom Unit: A 'duration' value which specifies a custom time unit. Accepts values like "6h" for 6 hours, "1m30s" for 1 minute and 30 seconds. Valid time units are "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m", "h".


### RecordTime
Example:
`time__RecordTime_2006-01-02_2018-03-04_d`

RecordTime is for a timestamp in a record which applies to the whole record. Any field in the record which will be stored as a 'time' field in FeatureBase will have this time associated with its value. Note that using this field type alone will not explicitly create a field in FeatureBase.

Argument 1: Layout: gives an example format for how the date value should be parsed. The default value for layout is '2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00'. Write this same datetime in whatever format your values have. For example, for a traditional MM/DD/YYYY representation, you would use '01/02/2006' for layout.

Argument 2 - Epoch: The 'zero' timestamp from which the int values are calculated. Written using the same layout as specified by argument 1.

Argument 3 - Unit: the incoming value will be interpreted as a duration with this Unit, starting at the configured Epoch. Can be `"d"`, `"h"`, `"m"`, `"s"`, `"ms"`, `"us"`, `"ns"`, for day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, or nanosecond respectively. Defaults to `"s"`.


### Timestamp
Example:
`purchase_date__Timestamp_s_2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00_2018-03-04T15:04:05Z_ms`

Timestamp fields are implemented internally the same way as integer fields and store the number of time units (e.g. seconds) since an epoch. By default, the time unit is in seconds and the epoch is midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. Adjusting the granularity and epoch can reduce the storage requirements and computation time when processing records.

Argument 1 - Granularity: the resolution at which the incoming values will be stored. Allowed values are `s`, `ms`, `us`, `ns`. Defaults to `"s"`.

Argument 2 - Layout: gives an example format for how the date value should be parsed. The default value is RFC3339Nano: '2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00'. Write this same datetime in whatever format your values have. Refer to [Go's format docs](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#pkg-constants).

Argument 3 - Epoch: The 'zero' timestamp from which the int values are calculated. Written using the same layout as specified by argument 2.

Argument 4 - Unit: the incoming value will be interpreted as a duration with this Unit, starting at the configured Epoch. Can be `"d"`, `"h"`, `"m"`, `"s"`, `"ms"`, `"us"`, `"ns"`, for day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, or nanosecond respectively. Defaults to `"s"`.


### StringArray
Example:
`tags__StringArray_`

StringArray is similar to the `String` type, but expects multiple values in a single record. Each value will be set in the corresponding row of the FeatureBase 'set' or 'time' field. To retrieve Array values from a CSV file, the data within the CSV column should be a comma separated list of array values enclosed in double quotes, e.g. `"Georgia,Texas,Oregon"`.

Argument 1 — Time Quantum: If this argument is provided, the field will be a "time" field rather than "set". "time" fields work similarly to "set" fields but each value can have a coarse grained timestamp associated with it. The granularity is controlled by this argument and can be anything from yearly down to hourly. See the [FeatureBase Data Model docs](/explanations/data-modeling) for more information about time fields.

### IDArray
Example:
`links__IDArray_`

IDArray is similar to the `ID` type, but expects multiple values in a single record. Each value will be set in the corresponding row of the FeatureBase 'set' or 'time'  field. To retrieve Array values from a CSV file, the data within the CSV column should be a comma separated list of values enclosed in double quotes, e.g. `"10,23,18"`.

Argument 1 — Time Quantum: If this argument is provided, the field will be a "time" field rather than "set". "time" fields work similarly to "set" fields but each value can have a coarse grained timestamp associated with it. The granularity is controlled by this argument and can be anything from yearly down to hourly. See the [FeatureBase Data Model docs](/explanations/data-modeling) for more information about time fields.

### Ignore
Example:
`uuid__Ignore`

Ignore the value in this field. If you have values you don't want to ingest, but it is inconvenient to remove them ahead of time, you can use the Ignore field to explicitly ignore them.
