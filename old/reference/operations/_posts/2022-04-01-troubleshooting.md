## Things to Have Handy

*   Logs

It may be necessary to restart FeatureBase with verbose logging or more granular tracing enabled.


## Profiling

If you are experiencing performance issues, we'll likely ask you to profile various components. All components written in Golang have profiling support enabled, this is described in detail here: [https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/). As a quick reference example:


```shell
wget host:port/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=10
```


which will download a file that you can send over for analysis, or


```shell
go tool pprof host:port/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=10
```


which will directly bring up Go's command line tool for viewing and analyzing profiling information.
