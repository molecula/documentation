In order to monitor FeatureBase, DataDog can be configured to capture monitoring metrics. By following these steps, DataDog will be able to display basic system level metrics and FeatureBase metrics if FeatureBase is configured to write `prometheus` or `statsd` data and FeatureBase and/or ingestion logs. 

If you’re running on EC2 and would like CloudWatch metrics, follow the [Getting Started with Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/amazon_web_services/?tab=roledelegation#installation) tutorial. 


## Configuring FeatureBase

In order to get metrics in Datadog, you’ll need to first configure FeatureBase to write metrics. This is done in your `featurebase.conf` file. `featurebase.conf` is likely located at `/etc/featurebase.conf` but you can search for it by running `sudo find / -name featurebase.conf`.

For prometheus metrics, include the following in featurebase.conf:

```[metric]
    service = "prometheus"
    poll-interval = "0m15s"
```

For statsd metrics, include the following in `featurebase.conf`:


```[metric]
    service = "statsd"
    poll-interval = "0m15s"
    host = "localhost:8125"
```

For more on configuring FeatureBase, visit !!featurebase configuration.

To verify if FeatureBase is writing prometheus metrics, run curl `localhost:10101/metrics` and confirm there are FeatureBase metrics being written. For more on FeatureBase metrics, visit !!featurebase monitoring.


## Installation

The initial Datadog install can be done by running

```
DD_AGENT_MAJOR_VERSION=7 DD_API_KEY=<your-api-key> DD_SITE="datadoghq.com" bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script.sh)"
```


## Update Configuration

There are two configuration files to update

```
sudo truncate -s 0 /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml
sudo nano /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml
```

Copy, paste, save and exit:


```
api_key: <your-api-key>

site: datadoghq.com

tags:
   - customer:<tag-value>
   - owner:<tag-value>

logs_enabled: true

process_config:
  process_collection:
    enabled: true

network_config:
  enabled: true
```

Then:

```
sudo truncate -s 0 /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf.yaml
sudo nano /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf.yaml
```

Copy, paste, save and exit:

```
init_config:

instances:

   - prometheus_url: http://localhost:10101/metrics
     namespace: "featurebase"
     metrics:
       - "*"
```

The default port for consumer metrics is `9093`

## Restart Datadog Agent

```
sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent
```

Check that the service unit is running:

```
sudo systemctl status datadog-agent
```

Check that prometheus metrics are being pulled into datadog:

```
sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent status
```

You should see something like the following in the returned message:

```
