___
## Molecula v4.0.0 2021-03-05

### Packages included:
- Molecula Pilosa v3.0.0
- Molecula Consumer v0.16.0
- Python-Molecula 1.8.0

### Summary:
This is the first release in the Molecula 4.x series! It includes a number of major improvements and also breaks backward compatibility in terms of the data format and configuration file for Pilosa.

### The highlights are:
- The new RBF storage backend which provides:
  - ACID semantics at a shard level.
  - Massively reduced heap usage for more predictable memory consumption and garbage collection behavior.
  - Ability to scale a single node far beyond the size of its memory.
- Etcd for clustering and node membership. Pilosa 3.0 embeds etcd which uses a Raft-based consensus algorithm to power a strongly consistent key/value store; Pilosa uses this to maintain cluster state, node state, and data schema. This reduces internal complexity in Pilosa's codebase while providing a more reliable store for important metadata.

### Changes in this release:
### Pilosa v3.0.0
Changes since v2.9.0

#### Added
- Percentiles query Changed
- Reorganize Pilosa data directory to avoid naming conflicts and support multiple storage backends
- Replace memberlist/gossip with etcd/Raft
- Add RBF storage backend as the newd efault; adds ACID semantics and low-level transactional support

#### Fixed
- Fix bug where cancelling a query might orphan workers
- Fix a racec ondition when deferring foreign-index

#### initialization
- Defer cluster messages until startup
- Fix enabled WebUI url log
- Fix GroupBy test which uses RowKey insteadof RowID
- Global Port Mapper avoids many races in portal location for cluster setup
- Avoid precondition failed (412) on ingest

#### Removed
- Removed ocs directory (nolongerused) 

### IDK v0.16.0
Changes since v0.15.0
#### Changed
- Updated to support Pilosa3.x series (for Molecula 4.x)
