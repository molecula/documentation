## HTTP API with Authentication
When authentication is enabled, all HTTP api endpoints and are secured using TLS. All requests must include a valid `Authorization` header containing a valid access token. This token may be obtained by following these [instructions](/how-tos/enable-auth#how-to-get-auth-token).

```
curl -XGET https://localhost:10101/schema -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Endpoint details

### List all index schemas

`GET /index`

Is equivalent to `GET /schema` and returns the same response.

### List index schema

`GET /index/{index-name}`

Returns the schema of the specified index in JSON.

``` request
curl -XGET localhost:10101/index/user
```
``` response
{
  "name": "user",
  "createdAt": 1591178953061239000,
  "options": {
    "keys": false,
    "trackExistence": true
  },
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "event",
      "createdAt": 1591178962332452000,
      "options": {
        "type": "set",
        "cacheType": "ranked",
        "cacheSize": 50000,
        "keys": false
      }
    }
  ],
  "shardWidth": 1048576
}
```

### Create index

`POST /index/{index-name}`

Creates an index with the given name.

The request payload is in JSON, and may contain the `options` field. The `options` field is a JSON object with the following options:

* `keys` (bool): Enables using column keys instead of column IDs.
* `trackExistence` (bool): Enables or disables existence tracking on the index. Required for [Not](/reference/pql#not) queries. It is `true` by default.

``` request
curl -XPOST localhost:10101/index/user -d '{"options":{"keys":true}}'
```
``` response
{"success":true,"name":"user","createdAt":1591179042178854000}
```

### Remove index

`DELETE /index/index-name`

Removes the given index.

``` request
curl -XDELETE localhost:10101/index/user
```
``` response
{"success":true}
```

### Query index

`POST /index/{index-name}/query`

Sends a [query](/reference/pql) to the FeatureBase server with the given index. The request body is UTF-8 encoded text and response body is in JSON by default.

``` request
curl localhost:10101/index/user/query \
     -X POST \
     -d 'Row(language=5)'
```
``` response
{
    "results": [
        {
            "columns": [
                100
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

:::note
Prior to Molecula v4.3, the response of a `Row` query would also include an "attrs" field.
:::

In order to send protobuf binaries in the request and response, set `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to: `application/x-protobuf`.

The query is executed for all [shards](/reference/glossary#shard) by default. To use specified shards only, set the `shards` query argument to a comma-separated list of slice indices.

``` request
curl "localhost:10101/index/user/query?shards=0,1" \
     -X POST \
     -d 'Row(language=5)'
```
``` response
{
    "results": [
        {
            "columns": [
                100
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Import Data

`POST /index/{index-name}/field/{field-name}/import`

Supports high-rate data ingest to a particular shard of a particular field. Import endpoints are used by ingesters; it is not usually necessary to use this endpoint directly.

The request payload is protobuf encoded with the following schema. The RowKeys
and/or ColumnKeys fields are used if the FeatureBase field or index are configured
for keys respectively. Otherwise, the RowIDs and ColumnIDs fields are used. They
must have the same number of items, and each index into those two lists
represents a particular bit to be set. Timestamps are optional, but if they
exist must also contain the same number of items as rows and columns. The
column IDs must all be in the shard specified in the request.

Some endpoints and data structures include a `CreatedAt` fields.
This is typically stored as a timestamp, but it's purpose is not to inform of the creation date of a particular index or field,
but to serve as a unique identifier for use in cache invalidation.

The problem is that users of FeatureBase (such as [ingesters](/explanations/ingesters))
can usually assume that translation keys for records and field values never change - they are only appended to, and can therefore be trivially cached.
This is true except in cases where an index or field gets deleted and then recreated,
or if FeatureBase is restored from a backup.
So the ingesters must send their current `CreatedAt` value which will have changed if either of those two conditions has occured (or if FeatureBase was just restarted),
and the ingester will know that it needs to drop its cache.

```protobuf
message ImportRequest {
    string Index = 1;
    string Field = 2;
    uint64 Shard = 3;
    repeated uint64 RowIDs = 4;
    repeated uint64 ColumnIDs = 5;
    repeated int64 Timestamps = 6;
    repeated string RowKeys = 7;
    repeated string ColumnKeys = 8;
    int64 IndexCreatedAt = 9;
    int64 FieldCreatedAt = 10;
}
```

### Check Mutex State

`GET /index/{index-name}/field/{field-name}/mutex-check`

Checks the given field for mutex violations, specifically records with more than
one value set. Accepts two optional query parameters:

* `details` (bool): Report the specific values set, not just the record IDs.
* `limit` (integer): Limit reporting to the given number of items.

The response is a JSON object. If `details` is false, the object will be an array
of string values when the index is keyed, or integer values for unkeyed indexes.
If `details` is true, it will be an object mapping the string/integer record IDs
to string values for a keyed field, and integer values for an unkeyed field.

``` request
curl localhost:10101/index/user/field/example/mutex-check \
     -X GET
```
``` response
[
    "record-key1",
    "record-key2"
]
```

``` request
curl localhost:10101/index/user/field/example/mutex-check?details=true \
     -X GET
```
``` response
{
    "record-key1": [
        "value-key1",
        "value-key2"
    ],
    "record-key2": [
        "value-key1",
        "value-key2"
    ]
}
```

#### Limitations

When a limit is specified, if different nodes in a cluster have different
conflicting values for a record, not all of those values will be reported;
the accumulation of known conflicts stops once enough conflicting records have
been seen, even though results from other nodes might conceivably add conflicts
to those records.

If no node has multiple values for a record, but two nodes have differing
values for the records, this endpoint does not detect that.

### Create field

`POST /index/{index-name}/field/{field-name}`

Creates a field in the given index with the given name.

The request payload is in JSON, and may contain the `options` field. The `options` field is a JSON object which must contain a `type`:

* `type` (string): Sets the field type and type options.
* `keys` (bool): Enables using column keys instead of column IDs (optional).

Valid `type`s and correspondonding options are listed below:

* `set`
    * `cacheType` (string): [ranked](/explanations/data-modeling#ranked) or [LRU](/explanations/data-modeling#lru) caching on this field. Default is `ranked`.
    * `cacheSize` (int): Number of rows to keep in the cache. Default is 50,000.
* `int`
    * `min` (int): Minimum integer value allowed for the field.
    * `max` (int): Maximum integer value allowed for the field.
* `timestamp`
    * `timeUnit` (string): [Granularity](/explanations/data-modeling#timestamp-field-implementation). Allowed values are `s`, `ms`, `us`, `ns`. `s` is the default.
* `bool`
    * (boolean fields take no arguments)
* `time`
    * `timeQuantum` (string): [Time Quantum](/explanations/data-modeling#time-quantum) for this field.
* `mutex`
    * `cacheType` (string): [ranked](/explanations/data-modeling#ranked) or [LRU](/explanations/data-modeling#lru) caching on this field. Default is `ranked`.
    * `cacheSize` (int): Number of rows to keep in the cache. Default is 50,000.

The following example creates an `int` field called "quantity" capable of storing values from -1000 to 2000:

``` request
curl localhost:10101/index/user/field/quantity \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"options": {"type": "int", "min": -1000, "max":2000}}'
```
``` response
{"success":true,"name":"quantity","createdAt":1591180110914425000}
```

Integer fields are stored as n-bit range-encoded values. FeatureBase supports 63-bit, signed integers with values between `min` and `max`.

``` request
curl localhost:10101/index/user/field/language -X POST
```
``` response
{"success":true,"name":"language","createdAt":1591180128294321000}
```

``` request
curl localhost:10101/index/repository/field/stats \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"options":{"type": "int", "min": 0, "max": 1000000}}'
```
``` response
{"success":true,"name":"stats","createdAt":1591180737881627000}
```

### Remove field

`DELETE /index/{index-name}/field/{field-name}`

Removes the given field.

``` request
curl -XDELETE localhost:10101/index/user/field/language
```
``` response
{"success":true}
```

### List all index schemas

`GET /schema`

Returns the schema of all indexes in JSON.

``` request
curl -XGET localhost:10101/schema
```
``` response
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "name": "user",
      "createdAt": 1591178953061239000,
      "options": {
        "keys": false,
        "trackExistence": true
      },
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "event",
          "createdAt": 1591178962332452000,
          "options": {
            "type": "set",
            "cacheType": "ranked",
            "cacheSize": 50000,
            "keys": false
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "language",
          "createdAt": 1591180128294321000,
          "options": {
            "type": "set",
            "cacheType": "ranked",
            "cacheSize": 50000,
            "keys": false
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "quantity",
          "createdAt": 1591180110914425000,
          "options": {
            "type": "int",
            "base": 0,
            "bitDepth": 0,
            "min": -1000,
            "max": 2000,
            "keys": false,
            "foreignIndex": ""
          }
        }
      ],
      "shardWidth": 1048576
    }
  ]
}
```

### Duplicate schema into empty Pilosa cluster

`POST /schema`

To duplicate one Pilosa cluster's schema to another, it's possible to
pass the output of `GET /schema` as the request body of `POST /schema`
and all the indexes and fields in the schema will be created in
Pilosa.

Note that the `/schema` endpoint is not aware of foreign key relationships
between indexes, so this may not succeed when the schema includes an
index with a foreign key associated with an index that is defined
later in the schema.

The behavior of POSTing a schema to a non-empty Pilosa cluster
is undefined.


``` request
# after (e.g.) curl -XGET localhost:10101/schema > schema.json
curl -XPOST localhost:10101/schema --data-binary @schema.json
```

Response: `204 No Content`
-->

### Get version

`GET /version`

Returns the version of the FeatureBase server.

``` request
curl -XGET localhost:10101/version
```
``` response
{"version":"2.0.0-alpha.20-6-gb9d8d6b4"}
```

### Get status

`GET /status`

Returns the status of the cluster.

```request
curl -XGET localhost:10101/status
```
```response
{
  "state": "NORMAL",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "1b018ce0-5de5-4da9-9285-6c4c0d8106f9",
      "uri": {
        "scheme": "http",
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 10101
      },
      "grpc-uri": {
        "scheme": "http",
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 20101
      },
      "isCoordinator": true,
      "state": "READY"
    }
  ],
  "localID": "1b018ce0-5de5-4da9-9285-6c4c0d8106f9"
}
```

### Get active queries

`GET /queries`

Returns the set of active queries. Supports pretty printing in `text/plain` format or JSON output in `application/json` format.
Also includes the amount of time that the query has been running (in nanoseconds when using JSON).

```request
curl -XGET localhost:10101/queries
```
```response
182.412µs  All()
```

```request
curl -XGET -H "Accept: application/json" localhost:10101/queries
```
```response
[{"query":"All()","age":135123}]
```

### Get query history
`GET /query-history`

Returns a list of objects representing historical queries.

This endpoint supports the query history display in the UI.

Each node maintains a separate list of queries that it served,
of length configured with `--query-history-length` (default 100).

The response combines the query history from all nodes, which
results in some duplication of the PQL values, but distinguishable
via the nodeID.

Some entries in the history may result from translated or generated
queries created during the execution process of explicit query requests.

`runtimeNanoseconds` is the query's execution time in nanoseconds. Note
that this execution time may not exactly match the `duration` value
reported in other contexts.

``` request
curl -XPOST localhost:10101/query-history
```

```json
[
  {
    "PQL": "Count(All())",
    "nodeID": "32ce5e768b0d8ca5",
    "index": "i",
    "start": "2021-04-14T10:42:34.167919-05:00",
    "runtimeNanoseconds": 344834
  },
  {
    "PQL": "Count(Row(f<\"2021-04-14T15:40:02Z\"))",
    "nodeID": "32ce5e768b0d8ca5",
    "index": "j",
    "start": "2021-04-14T10:42:34.167793-05:00",
    "runtimeNanoseconds": 573245
  },
]
```


### Recalculate Caches

`POST /recalculate-caches`

Recalculates the caches for TopN queries on demand. The cache is recalculated every 10
seconds by default. This endpoint can be used to recalculate the cache
before the 10 second interval. This should probably only be used in
integration tests and not in a typical production workflow. Note that
in a multi-node cluster, the cache is only recalculated on the node
that receives the request.

``` request
curl -XPOST localhost:10101/recalculate-caches
```

Response: `204 No Content`
