The `Set()` call associates or assigns a value to a record in a specified field. If the value we are assigning is in a Mutex, Int, Decimal, or Timestamp field, the current value is overwritten. If the value we are assigning is in a Set or Time field, all previous values will remain.

While using "Set" in PQL is a convenient way to get familiar with FeatureBase, it's almost always better to use a dedicated ingest tool. See [ingesters](/explanations/ingesters) for details.

## Call Definition
```
Set(UINT_OR_STRING, FIELD=FIELD_VALUE, TIMESTAMP)
```

#### Mandatory Arguments
- `UINT_OR_STRING` : the record to write to -- UINT or unsigned int for a non-keyed index and string for a keyed index.
- `FIELD` : the name of the field that contains the value we want to associate with the record
- `FIELD_VALUE` : the value we want to associate with the record

#### Optional Arguments
- `TIMESTAMP` : when FIELD is a Time field, this is an optional arguement and is used to associate this relationship with a specific time. Otherwise, it should not be provided.

#### Returns
- boolean
  - true indicates that the value was update or added.
  - false indicates that the value was not updated or added -- in some cases this means the value already existed or was alread equal to the desired value.
