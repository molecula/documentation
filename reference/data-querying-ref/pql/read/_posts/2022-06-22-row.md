The `Row()` query returns a set of record IDs / keys for records that have been filtered in some way. You can think of `Row()` as serving a similar function to the `WHERE` clause in SQL.

There are two different call definitions for `Row()`. One for Set, Mutex, and Time fields and another for Int, Decimal, and Timestamp fields. For more information on field types in FeatureBase, go [here](/data-ingestion/enterprise/ingesters#field-types).
<!---
In order to better understand the `Row()` query, it's helpful to understand the difference between Timestamp and Time fields. To learn more about modeling time in FeatureBase, go [here](/reference/modeling-time).

## Call Definition

### Set, Mutex, and Time Fields
```
Row(FIELD = FIELD_VALUE, from = TIMESTAMP, to = TIMESTAMP)
```
Note: Time fields are similar to Set fields except there is one or more date and time associated with each relationship between a record and field value. For that reason, you can only use the *from* and *to* arguments on Time fields. 

#### Mandatory Arguments
- `FIELD` : the name of a field in the index being queried
- `FIELD_VALUE` : a field value within a Set, Mutex or Time field, FIELD

#### Optional Arguments
- `from` : the start date and time  when querying Time fields (`TIMESTAMP` formatted like `'2006-01-02T00:00:00Z'`). `TIMESTAMP` here is an *inclusive* value - i.e. records with relationships made on or after this time will be included in the result -- for Time fields only.
- `to`: the end date and time when querying Time fields (`TIMESTAMP` formatted like `'2006-01-02T00:00:00Z'`). `TIMESTAMP` here is an *exclusive* value - i.e. records with relationships made before this time (but not on this time) will be included in the result -- for Time fields only.

#### Returns
- list of record IDs or record keys

### Int, Decimal, Timestamp Fields
```
Row(VALUE OPERATOR FIELD OPERATOR VALUE)
```
#### Mandatory Arguments
- `FIELD` : the name of a field in the index being queried
- `VALUE` : a integer, decimal, or timestamp value - consistent with the field type of FIELD (e.g. 1, 10.2, '2006-01-02T05:01:00Z') -- the first `VALUE` is *optional*
- `OPERATOR` : >, <, <=, >=, ==, or != -- the first `OPERATOR` is *optional*

#### Optional Arguments

#### Returns
- list of record IDs or record keys

## Examples
#### Raw Event Data:
Each row below represents a purchase event by a customer in some system. There is an event ID (`_id`),  customer ID (`customer_id`), brand that customer purchased from (`brand`), and the time the purchase was made (`time`).

```
 _id | brand  | customer_id |         time
-----+--------+-------------+----------------------
 1   | brand1 | 0           | 2021-01-02T02:45:00Z
 2   | brand2 | 0           | 2021-01-05T08:30:00Z
 3   | brand3 | 1           | 2019-07-24T11:15:00Z
 4   | brand1 | 1           | 2020-09-12T12:30:00Z
 5   | brand1 | 2           | 2021-07-07T18:25:00Z
 6   | brand3 | 2           | 2021-08-06T16:15:00Z
 7   | brand1 | 4           | 2020-10-01T20:45:00Z
 8   | brand4 | 4           | 2021-10-01T20:45:00Z
 9   | brand4 | 5           | 2022-01-13T11:00:00Z
 10  | brand1 | 0           | 2022-03-15T02:55:00Z
```
#### Raw Customer Data:
Each row represents a customer. Note the `_id` column in this data corresponse to a `customer_id` column in the data above.
```
_id | age
----+-----
 0  | 23
 1  | 31
 2  | 28
 3  | 19
 4  | 25
 5  | 40
``` 

The raw data above can be ingested to FeatureBase in at least three ways.
- An *events index* and a seperate *users index*. In this case, the two indexes would look like raw data looks above. One index would be built around purchase events (i.e. each record is a different purchase event) and one index would be built around users (i.e. each record is a different user).
- A *users index* where the time associated with purchase relationships (customer / brand) doesn't matter. Here each record would be a user and we'd use a Set field to track which users have bought from which brands. Note we lose the time information when using a Set field. This was done in the `customer_set` index below.
- A *users index* where the time associated with each relationship (customer / brand) does matter. Here each record would be a user and a Time field to track which users have bought from which brands. This was done in the `customer_time` index below.

#### FeatureBase Data
```
Index: customer_set (non-keyed index) 
 _id | age (Int) | has_purchased (Set) | last_purchase (Timestamp)
-----+-----------+---------------------+---------------------------
 0   |    23     | ["brand1","brand2"] | 2021-01-05T08:30:00Z
 1   |    31     | ["brand1","brand3"] | 2020-09-12T12:30:00Z
 2   |    28     | ["brand1","brand3"] | 2021-08-06T16:15:00Z
 3   |    19     | []                  | null
 4   |    25     | ["brand1","brand4"] | 2021-10-01T20:45:00Z
 5   |    40     | ["brand4"]          | 2022-01-13T11:00:00Z

Index: customer_time (non-keyed index)
 _id | age (Int) | has_purchased (Time)
-----+-----------+---------------------
 0   | 23        | ["brand1","brand2"]
 1   | 31        | ["brand1","brand3"]
 2   | 28        | ["brand1","brand3"]
 3   | 19        | []
 4   | 25        | ["brand1","brand4"]
 5   | 40        | ["brand4"]
```

In both indexes above, a customer table was create with a customer ID as the record ID. Some information about the customer (e.g. age) was included. In the first index (`customer_set`), a Set field is used to store purchase history. Here we're tacking the brands each customer has purchased from but there is no time associated with the relationship. In the second index (`customer_time`), a Time field is used to store purchase history. This means there is at least one time associated with each relationship that can be used for range queries.

### Example 1
What customers have purchased from brand1?

#### Query
```
[customer_set]Row(has_purchased=brand1)
```
#### Tabular Response
```
 _id
-----
 0
 1
 2
 4
```
#### HTTP Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "columns": [
        0,
        1,
        2,
        4
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
#### Explanation
Customers 0, 1, 2, and 4 are the only customer that had a purchase event with brand1.

<hr>
### Example 2
Which customers have purchased from brand3 during 2021?

```
[customer_time]Row(has_purchased=brand3, from='2021-01-01', to='2022-01-01')
```
#### Tabular Response
```
 _id
-----
 2
```

#### HTTP Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "columns": [
        2
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Explanation
Note the primary index is `customer_time`. In that index, the `has_purchased` field is a Time field. This allows us to use the from / to arguments to search for relationship made during a given time window. This is not possible in the `customer_set` index which uses a Set field for the `has_purchased` field. Looking at the raw events data, only customer 2 purchased from brand 3 during 2021.

<hr>

### Example 3
What customer are between the age of 20 and 30?

```
[customer_set]Row(20 < age < 30)
```
#### Tabular Response
```
 _id
-----
 0
 2
 4
```

#### HTTP Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "columns": [
        0,
        2,
        4
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Explanation
Customer 0, 2, and 4 are between the ages of 20 and 30.

<hr>
### Example 4
What customers made their last purchase in after the start 2022?

```
[customer_set]Row(last_purchase > "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z")
```
#### Tabular Response
```
 _id
-----
 5
```

#### HTTP Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "columns": [
        5
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Explanation
Only customer 5's last purchase was made after the start of 2022.
