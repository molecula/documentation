The `Extract()` query allows the user to extract the values of specified fields for specified records. The `Extract()` query is similar the `SELECT` argument in SQL -- see example 1 below for the PQL equivalment to `SELECT * FROM table` in SQL.

The task of retrieving all data for a record is generally more expensive in FeatureBase as compared to relational databases because of the way data is stored. For that reason, using the `Extract()` query for many fields and records is not advisable.

`Extract()` does not currently support filters on the backing [rows call](/data-querying/pql#rows-calls) -- i.e. `Rows()` arguments should look exactly like `Rows(FIELD_NAME)`. Additionally, contrary to the standard definition of [Rows()](/reference/data-querying-ref/pql/read/rows), any field type can be used as the argument to `Rows()` when `Rows()` is used as an argument to `Extract()`.

Time fields are treated as Set fields -- i.e. the `Extract()` output will include all values for a record that were set at any time.

## Call Definition

```
Extract(ROW_CALL, ROWS_CALL, ... )
```

#### Mandatory Arguments
 - `ROW_CALL` : the [row call](/data-querying/pql#row-calls){:target="_blank"} used to filter records
 - `ROWS_CALL` : any [rows call](/data-querying/pql#rows-calls){:target="_blank"} (set of record IDs / keys). Again, contrary to the standard definition of [Rows()](/reference/data-querying-ref/pql/read/rows), any field type can be used as the argument to `Rows()` when `Rows()` is used as an argument to `Extract()`.

#### Optional Arguments
- `...` : Any number of additional [rows calls](/data-querying/pql#rows-calls){:target="_blank"} seperated by commas. contrary to the standard definition of [Rows()](/reference/data-querying-ref/pql/read/rows), any field type can be used as the argument to `Rows()` when `Rows()` is used as an argument to `Extract()`.

#### Returns
An object with:
- a list of the selected fields under the "fields" key
- a list of "column" / "rows" pair under the "columns" key
  - "column" contains the record ID / key
  - "rows" contains the field values associated with the record in "column" 

Field values are typed as such:

|Field Type             |`type`      |JSON Value Type                    |
|-----------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|
|Mutex (unkeyed)        |`"uint64"`  |positive integer ID or `null`      |
|Mutex (keyed)          |`"string"`  |string or `null`                   |
|Integer                |`"int64"`   |integer or `null`                  |
|Integer (foreign-index)|`"string"`  |string or `null`                   |
|Decimal                |`"decimal"` |FeatureBase decimal value or `null`|
|Set (unkeyed)          |`"[]uint64"`|array of positive integer IDs      |
|Set (keyed)            |`"[]string"`|array of strings                   |
|Time (unkeyed)         |`"[]uint64"`|array of positive integer IDs      |
|Time (keyed)           |`"[]string"`|array of strings                   |

Extract all the data from the customer index (i.e. the PQL equivalent to SQL SELECT * FROM customer)?

#### Query
```
[customer]Extract(All(), Rows(age), Rows(has_purchased), Rows(last_purchase))
```
#### Tabular Response
```
 _id | age |    has_purchased    |     last_purchase
-----+-----+---------------------+------------------------
 0   | 23  | ["brand1","brand2"] | "2021-01-05T08:30:00Z"
 1   | 31  | ["brand1","brand3"] | "2020-09-12T12:30:00Z"
 2   | 28  | ["brand1","brand3"] | "2021-08-06T16:15:00Z"
 3   | 19  | []                  | null
 4   | 25  | ["brand1","brand4"] | "2021-10-01T20:45:00Z"

#### Explanation
Similar to `SELECT * FROM customer`, we get all the data in the index.

<hr>
### Example 2
Output the list of brands each customer has purchased from for customers younder than 26.

```
[customer]Extract(Row(age<26), Rows(has_purchased))
```
#### Tabular Response
```
 _id |    has_purchased
-----+---------------------
 0   | ["brand1","brand2"]
 3   | []
 4   | ["brand1","brand4"]
```

#### HTTP Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "has_purchased",
          "type": "[]string"
        }
      ],
      "columns": [
        {
          "column": 0,
          "rows": [
            [
              "brand1",
              "brand2"
            ]
          ]
        },
        {
          "column": 3,
          "rows": [
            []
          ]
        },
        {
          "column": 4,
          "rows": [
            [
              "brand1",
              "brand4"
            ]
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Explanation
`Row(age<26)` returns records `[0,3,4]`. `Extract(..., Rows(has_purchased))` pulls the list of brands those records / customers have purchased from.
