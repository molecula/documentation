This is a tutorial / how-to on setting up FeatureBase and Datadog to monitor FeatureBase and the system it's running on. This will expose FeatureBase application metrics and basic system level metrics to Datadog. Go to [FeatureBase Monitoring](/community/monitoring){:target="\_blank"} to see the application mertics that will be exposed. Go to [Datadog System Checks](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/system/){:target="\_blank"} for the list of system level metrics that will be exposed.

If you’re running on EC2 and would like CloudWatch metrics, follow the [Getting Started with Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/amazon_web_services/?tab=roledelegation#installation){:target="\_blank"} tutorial.


## Configuration of FeatureBase

First, configure FeatureBase to write metrics that Datadog can scrape. This is done in your `featurebase.conf` file. `featurebase.conf` is likely located at `/etc/featurebase.conf` but you can search for it by running `sudo find / -name featurebase.conf`.

Include the following text in featurebase.conf:

```
[metric]
    service = "prometheus"
    poll-interval = "0m15s"
```

Note that FeatureBase metrics will be re-written every 15 seconds based on the configuration above. For more on configuring FeatureBase, visit [Featurebase Configuration](/community/community-setup/featurebase-configuration){:target="\_blank"}.

To verify FeatureBase is writing prometheus metrics, run `curl localhost:10101/metrics` on the FeatureBase host and confirm there are FeatureBase metrics being written. Again, for more on FeatureBase metrics, visit [FeatureBase Monitoring](/community/monitoring){:target="\_blank"}.


## Installation of Datadog Agent

The initial Datadog install can be done by running

```
DD_AGENT_MAJOR_VERSION=7 DD_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> DD_SITE="datadoghq.com" bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script.sh)"
```

Make sure to add your Datadog API key to the command above.

## Configuration of Datadog

There are two configuration files to update. The first is the Datadog configuration file. Save the original and then update `datadog.yaml`. 

```
sudo cp /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml /etc/datadog-agent/datadog_original.yaml
sudo truncate -s 0 /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml
sudo nano /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml
```

Copy, paste, save and exit:


```
api_key: <YOUR_API_KEY>

site: datadoghq.com

tags:
   - owner:<tag-value>
   - project:<tag-value>

logs_enabled: true

process_config:
  process_collection:
    enabled: true

network_config:
  enabled: true
```

The second file to update is the metrics configuration file. Again, save the original and update `openmetrics.d/conf.yaml`. 

```
sudo cp /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf.yaml /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf_original.yaml
sudo truncate -s 0 /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf.yaml
sudo nano /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf.yaml
```

Copy, paste, save and exit:

```
init_config:

instances:

   # update the host and port as necessary
   - prometheus_url: http://localhost:10101/metrics
     namespace: "featurebase"
     metrics:
       - "*"

   # you can grab consumer metrics by adding an entry here
   # here is an example (given the default port for consumer metrics is 9093)
   # - prometheus_url: http://localhost:9093
   #   namespace: "consumer"
   #   metrics:
   #     - "*"

```

## Restart Datadog Agent

```
sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent
```

Check that the service unit is running:

```
sudo systemctl status datadog-agent
```

Check that prometheus metrics are being pulled into datadog:

```
sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent status
```

You should see something like the following in the returned message:

```
