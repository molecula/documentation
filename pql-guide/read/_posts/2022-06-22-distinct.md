The `Distinct()` query returns the distinct values in a field for a set of records.

`Distinct()` can always be used as a [row call](/pql-guide/pql#row-calls){:target="_blank"}. This, in conjunction with the index argument, gives users the ability to query accross indexes. Use caution to ensure you get the expected behavior. The examples below outline some considerations.

## Call Definitioin
    
```pql
Distinct(ROW_CALL, field=FIELD, index=INDEX)
```

#### Mandatory Arguments

- `field`: a string, FIELD, which is the name of some field in INDEX or a string which is the name of some field in the primary index (i.e. the index in square brackets before the query) -- the latter is the default when the `index` argument isn't supplied. The distinct values returned will be the distinct values from this field.

#### Optional Arguments
- `ROW_CALL` : the [row call](/pql-guide/pql#row-calls){:target="_blank"} use to filter records. Only the values of records returned by this [row call](/pql-guide/pql#row-calls){:target="_blank"} will be used in the computation of `Distinct()`. Note this [row call](/pql-guide/pql#row-calls){:target="_blank"} is run against the primary index (i.e. the index in square brackets) when there is not an `index` argument supplied. It is run against `INDEX` when the `index` argument is supplied.
- `index` : INDEX is the name of the index that FIELD exists in. When this argument is supplied, it is the index ROW_CALL is executed against. When it isn't supplied, FIELD should exist in the primary index and `ROW_CALL` will be executed on the primary index (i.e. the index in square brakets) 

#### Returns
- if FIELD is an unkeyed Set, Mutex, or Time field:
  - a list of field values (ID or unsigned integers) are return under the "columns" key
- if FIELD is a keyed Set, Mutex, of Time field:
  - a list of field values (strings) are returned under the "keys" key
  - a list of ID / unsigned integers are returned uner the "columns" key
  - the value of the "columns" key is essentially erroneous data; but note, these are the values that will be used if you're attempting you use `Distinct()` as a the [row call](/pql-guide/pql#row-calls){:target="_blank"}. In this case, you might get some unexpected behavior.
- if FIELD is an Int, Decimal, or Timestamp field:  
  - similar to the result of a [row call](/pql-guide/pql#row-calls){:target="_blank"}, `Distinct()` including a list of "columns". Dissimilarly, these results are separated into two groups -- one for negative values and one for positive values. This structure is necessary to accomodate signed values that are represented with bitsets.

## Examples
### Data:

```
Index: users (non-keyed index)

 _id | age (Int) | zipcode (Set)
-----+-----------+---------
 0   | 18        | 44444
 1   | 55        | 55555
 2   | 30        | 11111
 3   | 35        | 22222
 4   | 22        | 33333
 
Index: transactions (non-keyed index)

 _id | amount (Decimal) | category (Keyed Set) | userid (Non-keyed Set)
-----+------------------+----------------------+------------------------
 123 | 99.99            | Tools                | 0
 124 | 34.99            | Hardware             | 1
 125 | 129.99           | Tools                | 1
 126 | 29.99            | Plants               | 0
 127 | 12.99            | Food                 | 0
 128 | 399.99           | Drugs                | 4
 129 | 29.99            | Plants               | 2
 130 | 34.99            | Hardware             | 3

```

Note: In this case, the `userid` field in `transactions` was ingested as an ID field (non-keyed mutex in this case).

### Example 1   

What are the distinct ages in the users index?

#### Query
```
[users]Distinct(field=age)
```

#### Tabular Response
```

----
 18
 22
 30
 35
 55
```
#### HTTP Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "neg": {
        "columns": []
      },
      "pos": {
        "columns": [
          18,
          22,
          30,
          35,
          55
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Explanation
`Distinct()` returns the unique values in the `age` field of the `users` index. Note these distinct values are separated into negative and positive becuase `age` is an `Int` field. 

--------------------------------------------------------
### Example 2
What are the distinct prices of transactions?

#### Query
```
[transactions]Distinct(field=amount)
```

#### Tabular Response
```

-------
 1299
 2999
 3499
 9999
 12999
 39999
```
#### HTTP Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "neg": {
        "columns": []
      },
      "pos": {
        "columns": [
          1299,
          2999,
          3499,
          9999,
          12999,
          39999
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Explanation
`Distinct()` returns the unique values in the `amount` field of the `transactions` index. Note these distinct values are separated into negative and positive because age is an Decimal field.

--------------------------------------------------------
### Example 3
What are the distinct field values in the category field in the transactions index?

#### Query
```
[transactions]Distinct(field=category)
```
#### Tabular Response
```
   _id
----------
 Tools
 Hardware
 Plants
 Food
 Drugs
```
#### HTTP Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "columns": [
        1,
        2,
        3,
        4,
        5
      ],
      "keys": [
        "Tools",
        "Hardware",
        "Plants",
        "Food",
        "Drugs"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Explanation
`Distinct()` returns the unique values in the `category` field of the `transactions` index. Note the "columns" key returned by Distinct() in the HTTP response. In some sense, this is erroneous data. If this query is used as a [row call](/pql-guide/pql#row-calls){:target="_blank"}, the "columns" key values will be interpreted as record IDs. However, in this case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are not referencing record IDs.

--------------------------------------------------------
#### Example 4
How many distinct field value are there in the category field in the transactions index?

#### Query
```
[transaction]Count(
  Distinct(field=category)
)
```
#### Tabular Response
```
 count
-------
 5
```

```json
{
  "results": [
    5
  ]
}
```

#### Explanation 
`Count(Distinct())` can be used to count the number of unique field values in a field. In this case, there are 5.

--------------------------------------------------------
### Example 5
Which users have bought tools and is older than 25?
#### Query 
```
[users]Intersect(
           Row(age > 25),
           Distinct(Row(category=Tools), field=userid, index=transactions)
       )
```
#### Tabular Response
```
 _id
-----
 1
```
#### HTTP Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "columns": [
        1
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Explanation
`Row(age > 25)` return the users that are older than 25 - `[1, 2, 3]`. `Distinct()` is returning unique `userid`s from the `transactions` index where the transaction also had `category=Tools` -- `[0, 1]`. The two sets are intersected which gives `[1]`. This is an example of a query that spans multiple indexes. It works because the `userid` field in the `transactions` index have a soft reference to the records IDs in the `users` index. "Soft reference" here means there is not an actual contraint ensuring all the `userid` values in the `transactions` are actually record IDs in the `users` index. That would be enforced outside of FeatureBase in this example.
