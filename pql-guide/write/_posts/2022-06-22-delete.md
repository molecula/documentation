The `Delete()` call removes entire records. A [row call](/pql-guide/pql-introduction#row-calls){:target="_blank"} is used to determine which records will be deleted.

It is potentially a very heavy operation. It iterates over all fields and views in a set of records, removing the records. It also removes  all data from fields, existence bits, and key translation for the provided columns for all replicas in the cluster.

`Delete()` does not support deleting specific fields, only full records based on `ROW_CALL`. It doesnâ€™t support deletes from Kafka Delete Consumer or two separate clusters.

Note: while you could delete all records in an index using `Delete(All())`, this is not recommended, as [dropping an index](/community/community-api/grpc-api#deleteindex) would be a much more performant way of deleting all records in an index.

## Call Definition
```
Delete(ROW_CALL)
```

#### Mandatory Arguments
- `ROW_CALL` : the [row call](/pql-guide/pql-introduction#row-calls){:target="_blank"} used to determine which records to delete -- i.e. records returned by `ROW_CALL` will be deleted.

#### Optional Arguments

#### Returns
 - boolean
    - true indicates that the columns to delete were found AND deleted.
    - false indicates that the columns to delete were NOT found OR that they WERE found but not deleted.
