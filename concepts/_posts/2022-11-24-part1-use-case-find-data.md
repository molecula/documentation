title: Part 1 - establish use case and find your data
---

The first task is to establish:
* your use case, specifically what you want to know from your data
* where in your database that data is found

What you want to learn from your data is a subjective decision only you can answer.

This page includes examples and information that can help you make this decision.

## Before you begin

* [Learn about data modeling](/concepts/data-modeling-overview)

## Use case examples

These examples can be used to determine how your use case can be addressed by FeatureBase

| Use case | Description | Further information |
|---|---|---|
| Query data in fact and dimension tables |   | [Query fact and dimension tables](/concepts/query-fact-dimension-tables) |


## Where is my data?

FeatureBase can import and transform data from any data source, including:

* data source 1
* data source 2
* CSV

etc

## Next step
