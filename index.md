Welcome to FeatureBase! Here you will find various materials to help you use and operate FeatureBase. To navigate through the documentation you can use the navigation toolbar to the left of this section, or you can use the search bar in the upper right hand corner.

For those new to Molecula and FeatureBase we recommend the [Installation Guide](/how-tos/install-featurebase), [Getting Started](/quick-start-guide/enterprise) tutorial, and the [Architecture](/explanations/architecture) explanation.
