## Description

Fields are used to group rows into different categories.

Row IDs are namespaced by field such that the same row ID in a different field refers to a different row.

For ranked fields, rows are kept in sorted order within the field.

Fields are one of six types: set, int, timestamp, bool, time, and mutex.

<!-- TODO: glossary entries for each field type. section on another page detailing pros and cons of each field type and why you'd choose one over another for a particular data example. UI ingest wizard should automatically suggest an ordered list of 1-3 field types, each one having a tooltip explaining those pros and cons, and linking to that section -->
