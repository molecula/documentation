Pilosa Query Language (PQL) is FeatureBase's native query language and is a declarative set-based language like SQL.

## Before you begin


## How do PQL functions work?


PQL uses a function-compositional syntax to build expressions but use familiar parenthesis to call the syntax.

PQL functions:
* operate on bitmaps as the atomic elements of the data store
* express boolean operations of arbitrary complexity
* can also implement common data tasks like aggregation
