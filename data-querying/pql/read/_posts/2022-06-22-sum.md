`Sum()` computes the sum of values in an Int, Decimal, or Timestamp field in some subset of records (defined by a [row call](/data-querying/pql/introduction#row-calls){:target="_blank"}).

## Call Definition
```
Sum(ROW_CALL, field=FIELD)
```

#### Mandatory Arguments
 - `field` / `FIELD`: the name of the field to get summed. This must be an Int, Decimal, or Timestamp field.

#### Optional Arguments
 - `ROW_CALL` : the [row call](/data-querying/pql/introduction#row-calls){:target="_blank"} used to filter records to get the summation over.

#### Returns
- the sum of values in a field and the count of records that where included in that sum (i.e. the records returned by the row call and the records that didn't have null values in FIELD)

## Examples

### Data:
```
Index: customer (non keyed index)

 _id | age (Int) | has_purchased (Set) | last_purchase (Timestamp)
-----+-----------+---------------------+---------------------------
 0   |    23     | ["brand1","brand2"] | 2021-01-05T08:30:00Z
 1   |    31     | ["brand1","brand3"] | 2020-09-12T12:30:00Z
 2   |    28     | ["brand1","brand3"] | 2021-08-06T16:15:00Z
 3   |    19     | []                  | null
 4   |    25     | ["brand1","brand4"] | 2021-10-01T20:45:00Z
 5   |    40     | ["brand4"]          | 2022-01-13T11:00:00Z

### Example 1
What is the sum of customers age?

#### Query
```
[customer]Sum(field=age)
```
#### Tabular Response
```
 value | count
-------+-------
 166   | 6
```
#### HTTP Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "value": 166,
      "floatValue": 0,
      "decimalValue": null,
      "timestampValue": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "count": 6
    }
  ]
}
```
#### Explanation
The summation of ages for all customers is 166. Each record contributed to that summation so count is 6.

### Example 2
What is the sum of ages for customers who have purchased from brand 1?

#### Query
```
[customer]Sum(Row(has_purchased=brand1), field=age)
```
#### Tabular Response
```
 value | count
-------+-------
 107   | 4
```

#### HTTP Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "value": 107,
      "floatValue": 0,
      "decimalValue": null,
      "timestampValue": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "count": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Explanation
The row call returns `[0,1,2,4]` which is why the count is 4. The sum of their ages is 107.
