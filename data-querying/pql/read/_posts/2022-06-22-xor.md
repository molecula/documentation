id: xor
title: Xor()
sidebar_label: Xor()
---

The `Xor()` query performs a set xor on the row calls passed as arguments. This is equivalent to a [symmetric difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference)  over two or more sets. 

`Xor()` is a [row call](/data-querying/pql/introduction#row-calls){:target="_blank"}.

<!---
The venn diagram's in the symmetric difference link is helpful!

Let A be the first row call (set of record IDs / keys) and let B be the second row call (set of record IDs / keys). Then, `Xor(A, B)` is the set of records IDs that are in set A, are in set B, and not in both.

Now consider a third row call (set of record IDs / keys), C. We could have a PQL query like this: `Xor(A, B, C)`. This would be the set of records that are in set A (and not B or C), are in set B (and not A or C), are in set C (and not A or B), or are in set A, B and C.

## Examples

### Data:
```
Index: customer (non keyed index)

 _id | age (Int) | has_purchased (Set)          | last_purchase (Timestamp)
-----+-----------+------------------------------+---------------------------
 0   |    23     | ["brand1","brand2"]          | 2021-01-05T08:30:00Z
 1   |    31     | ["brand1","brand3"]          | 2020-09-12T12:30:00Z
 2   |    28     | ["brand1","brand3","brand4"] | 2021-08-06T16:15:00Z
 3   |    19     | []                           | null
 4   |    25     | ["brand1","brand4"]          | 2021-10-01T20:45:00Z
 5   |    40     | ["brand4"]                   | 2022-01-13T11:00:00Z

### Example 1
Which users have purchased from brand1 or brand4 but not both?

#### Query
```
[customer]Xor(
  Row(has_purchased = brand1), 
  Row(has_purchased = brand4)
)
```

#### Tabular Response
```

```
#### HTTP Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "columns": [
        0,
        1,
        2,
        5
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
#### Explanation
`Row(has_purchased = brand1)` returns `[0,1,2,4]` and `Row(has_purchased = brand4)` returns `[4,5]`. [0,1,2,5] are the records that can be found but aren't in both sets.

      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
#### Explanation
`Row(has_purchased = brand1)` returns `[0,1,2,4]`, `Row(has_purchased=brand3)` returns `[1,2]`, and `Row(has_purchased = brand4)` returns `[4,5]`. `[0,2]` are only contained in a single set and are thus returned. 5 is contained in all of the sets and is returned for that reason.
