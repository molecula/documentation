The `Sort()` call is used to get the IDs ordered by a specified field. This is used in combination with 
`Extract()` call to extract the values of specified fields ordered by the sort field. 

## Call Definition

```pql
Sort(ROW_CALL, field = FIELD, limit = UINT, offset = UINT, sort-desc=BOOL)
```

#### Mandatory Arguments
 - `ROW_CALL` : the [row call](/data-querying/pql/introduction#row-calls){:target="_blank"} used to filter records
 - `field` / `FIELD` : the name of the field to sort by. This supports Int, Decimal, Timestamp, Boolean and Mutex fields.

 #### Optional Arguments
 - `limit` : the number of records you'd like to limit the query to. For example, limit=0 returns nothing and limit=100 returns 100 records. This is an optional argument. If it's not supplied there will be no limit on the number of records returned.
 - `offset` : the offset from the beginning you'd like to use. For example, offset=0 starts at the beginning and could potentially return all the records. An offset=100 will start returning records after the first 100 that would have been returned by the `ROW_CALL`. This is an optional argument. If it's not supplied there will be no offset applied.
 - `sort-desc`: the order in which the results are sorted. For example, sort-desc=true returns the results in descending order of the value of the field. This is am optional argument.
 If nothing is supplied, the results are sorted in ascending order(sort-desc=false).

#### Returns
- list of record IDs or record keys, in the order of the value of the field.

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Explanation
`Row(age > 23)` sorted by `last_purchase` in descending order, returns `[5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 0 , 1]` which is then limited to `[5 , 4]` and the `Extract` pulls the 
records for these IDs.
